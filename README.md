# SystemAnalysis

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass project was to create a system for a company that specialized in training people how to drive and prepare to test at the DMV.  The client was a company named
DriverPass.  They wanted to design on online system where people could place reservations for driver training lessons, take an online class, and take practice DMV tests.  
I think I did well in most of the UML diagram designs as well as describing the functionality of the system through the requirements gathering.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would choose to work on my class diagram some more, and I made an error throughout the assignment where it was the IT director that should be resetting the 
passwords and Grant/Denying access not the boss because I miss read the name in the interview, so I would fix that.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I read the users needs from the interview with the client and pulled them out from there.  I modeled the whole system design around what came from the interview.  It is
important to give the user what they want because you want to satisfy the customer who will recommend you to other clients for work in the future.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?   

I approach designing software by gathering recourses from the client, through interviewing.  If there is already a system in place I would study that system as well.  You 
have to find out what the needs of the client are, and use your team to meet those goals.  Creating documentation is key.  I would build UML diagrams to help the programmers 
understand how the system is intended to work.  Submitting a Business Requirements document for the project is also essential as it sets the framework for the system.
